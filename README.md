# WhatsApp Alarm

WhatsApp Alarm is a Python script that uses the Twilio API to send a message and make a WhatsApp call at a scheduled time. With this script, you can set up a custom alarm on your mobile phone using WhatsApp as a notification platform.

To use WhatsApp Alarm, you'll need to have a Twilio account and a verified WhatsApp phone number in your account. You'll also need to install the Twilio Python library and configure your authentication credentials in the configuration file.

Once you've set everything up correctly, simply run the script and you'll receive a message and a WhatsApp call at the scheduled time. With this tool, you'll never forget an important appointment or work meeting again.
